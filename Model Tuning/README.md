# Model Tuning

Welcome to the **Model Tuning** section! This notebook explores hyperparameter tuning, a crucial step in optimizing machine learning models. By systematically adjusting model parameters, we can enhance performance and achieve better accuracy. We will compare different tuning strategies, including Grid Search, Random Search, and Bayesian Optimization.

**Note**: This notebook is intended for beginners, covering fundamental concepts and implementation steps. For a deeper understanding, please refer to the additional resources provided below.

# üìÇ Structure
This folder currently includes:

**Bayesian Optimization**: Bayesian Optimization is a sequential model-based optimization technique that builds a probabilistic model (typically using Gaussian Processes) to find optimal hyperparameters.

**Random Search**: Random Search is a hyperparameter tuning method that samples random combinations of hyperparameters to find the best model performance.

**Grid Search**: Grid Search is a hyperparameter tuning method that exhaustively tests all possible combinations of hyperparameters within a specified grid to find the optimal set.


## üîó Learning Flow
### **Start with Model Tuning Basics**: Learn about hyperparameters and their impact on model performance.

###  **Explore Different Tuning Methods**: Understand the strengths and limitations of Grid Search, Random Search, and Bayesian Optimization.
   
### **Bayesian Optimization** : Unlike Grid Search and Random Search, Bayesian Optimization builds a probabilistic model to select the most promising hyperparameter values intelligently.
   -**Topics to Cover**:

    a. Understand Bayesian Optimization: Learn about probabilistic models and acquisition functions (e.g., Expected 
          Improvement, Probability of Improvement, Upper Confidence Bound) to decide the next sampling point.

    b. Compare with Traditional Methods: See how Bayesian Optimization improves efficiency.

    c. Implement Optimization: Apply Bayesian tuning to a machine learning model.

    d. Visualize and Analyze: Interpret results to choose the best hyperparameters effectively.

## **Random Search and Grid Search**
When optimizing machine learning models, **hyperparameter tuning** is crucial for improving performance. Two common methods are:  
- **Random Search**  (explores randomly)  
- **Grid Search**  (systematically tests all combinations)  
 

## **üìå Takeaway**  

- If **computational resources are limited** ‚è≥ ‚Üí **Use Random Search**.  
- If you **need precision and have time** ‚è±Ô∏è ‚Üí **Use Grid Search**.  

By understanding these differences, you can **choose the best approach** for your hyperparameter tuning task! 

Unlike Bayesian Optimization, which builds a probabilistic model, Random Search and Grid Search are fundamental hyperparameter tuning techniques that systematically or randomly explore parameter spaces.

### **Topics to Cover**  

a. **Understanding the Methods** : Learn how **Random Search** samples random hyperparameters and how **Grid Search** exhaustively tests all possible combinations.  

b. **Efficiency vs. Exhaustiveness** : When to use **Random Search** for large search spaces and when **Grid Search** is preferable(speed vs accuracy). 

c. **Implementation Guide** : Apply both methods using **scikit-learn's GridSearchCV & RandomizedSearchCV** on a Decision Tree classifier.  

d. **Analysis & Best Practices** : Visualize search results, interpret key metrics, and optimize hyperparameters effectively.
