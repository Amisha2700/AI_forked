# Model Tuning

Welcome to the **Model Tuning** section! This folder provides an introduction to hyperparameter tuning, a crucial process in optimizing machine learning models. By systematically adjusting model parameters, you can improve performance and achieve better accuracy. We will cover different tuning strategies such as Grid Search, Random Search, and Bayesian Optimization.

**Note**: The notebooks here are designed for beginners. They introduce fundamental concepts but do not cover all tuning methods or advanced techniques. For more in-depth learning, refer to the recommended resources provided below.
