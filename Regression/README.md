# Regression

Welcome to the **Regression** section! This folder provides an introduction to regression techniques, which are fundamental for supervised learning tasks. Regression helps you model relationships between variables and make predictions, making it a crucial tool for analyzing trends and forecasting outcomes.  

**Note**: The notebooks here are designed for beginners. They introduce foundational concepts but do not cover all regression methods or advanced techniques. For a more comprehensive understanding, please refer to the recommended resources provided below.


## üìÇ Structure

This folder currently includes:
- **Linear Regression**: A supervised Machine Learning technique to predict continous numerical values.
- **Logistic Regression**: A supervised Machine Learning technique to classify values into distinct binary classes.

Each section includes **assignments** to help reinforce your understanding, along with **solutions** for self-assessment.

## üîó Learning Flow

Follow these steps to build a strong foundation in clustering techniques:

### 1. **Linear Regression**
   - **Purpose**: Demonstrate the relationship between independent and dependent variables.
   - **Topics to Cover**:
     - Simple Linear Regression
     - Multiple Linear Regression
     - Gradient Descent
   - **Resources**:
