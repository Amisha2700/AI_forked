# Data Preprocessing

Welcome to the **Data Preprocessing** section! This folder contains resources and guides to help you build essential data preprocessing skills. These skills are crucial for understanding, cleaning, and preparing data before using it in machine learning and data analysis tasks.

**Note**: The notebooks here are designed for beginners. They introduce foundational concepts but do not cover all available methods or advanced techniques. For a deeper understanding, please refer to the recommended authentic resources provided in each section.

## üìÇ Structure

This folder currently includes:
- **NumPy & Pandas**: Core libraries for data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Data Visualization**: Learn how to visually represent data insights effectively.

Each section contains **assignments** to reinforce your understanding, along with **solutions** for self-assessment.

## üîó Learning Flow

Follow these steps to build a strong foundation in data preprocessing:

### 1. **NumPy & Pandas**
   - **Purpose**: Together, NumPy and Pandas simplify handling and transforming data for analysis.
   - **Topics to Cover**:
     - Basics of arrays (NumPy) and data frames (Pandas)
     - Array and data frame manipulations (reshaping, stacking, splitting, filtering)
     - Data cleaning and handling missing values (Pandas)
     - Data grouping, merging, and reshaping (Pandas)
   - **Resources**:
     - [NumPy Official Documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/)
     - [Pandas Official Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
     - [NumPy Quickstart Tutorial](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html)
     - [The Fundamental Tool for Data Science in Python](https://medium.com/@m.franfuentes/numpy-the-fundamental-tool-for-data-science-in-python-fa2b605a3bf9)
     - [Data Analysis with Pandas](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas) (Kaggle mini-course)
     - [Data Analysis with Python Course ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPVsHOlRBBI) (video)

### 2. **Data Visualization**
   - **Purpose**: Visualization helps communicate insights and patterns within your data.
   - **Topics to Cover**:
     - Basics of plotting with Matplotlib and Seaborn
     - Histograms, scatter plots, bar plots, and line graphs
     - Customizing plots (colors, labels, styles)
     - Choosing the right type of plot for your data
   - **Resources**:
     - [Matplotlib Documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html)
     - [Seaborn Documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
     -[A Comprehensive Guide on Exploratory Data Analysis](https://medium.com/@pabbakavya123/a-comprehensive-guide-on-exploratory-data-analysis-eda-ab38f33d6abc)
     - [ Exploratory Data Analysis And Feature Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHFOANOHwh8) (video)

### 3. **Data Transformation**
   - **Purpose**: Data Transformation helps in making the data more useful and suitable for model building.
   - **Topics to Cover**:
     - Normalization (Min Max Normalization)
     - Standardization (Z - Score Scaling)
     - Log Transformation
     - Choosing the right one for your data.
   - **Resources**:
     - [Data Preprocessing and Transformation (sklearn Documentation)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html)
     - [Data Transformation and its types (GeeksForGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-transformation-in-data-mining/)

## üìù Assignments and Solutions

Each section includes assignments to help you apply the concepts you've learned. Solutions are provided for self-evaluation. We recommend attempting the assignments independently before checking the solutions for the best learning experience.

## üèÅ Getting Started

1. **Start with NumPy & Pandas**: Begin with arrays (NumPy) and data frames (Pandas) to build your data manipulation skills.
2. **Move on to Data Visualization**: Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations that highlight data insights.

Happy learning! Remember, mastering these tools will set you up for success in your journey with data science and machine learning. For more comprehensive learning, refer to the documentation and tutorials linked above.
