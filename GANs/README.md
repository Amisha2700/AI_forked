# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

Welcome to the **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** section! This folder provides an introduction to GANs, a class of deep learning models used for generating realistic synthetic data. GANs consist of two neural networks, a **Generator** and a **Discriminator**, that compete in a game-theoretic framework to improve data generation quality.

**Note**: The notebooks here introduce foundational GAN concepts but do not cover all advanced variations. For a more comprehensive understanding, please refer to the recommended resources provided below.

## üìÇ Structure

This folder currently includes:
  - **PyTorch Implementation**: A simple GAN trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset and GAN Architectures that explore the implementations of common GAN architectures such as DCGAN and WGAN in PyTorch.
  - **TensorFlow Implementation**: A GAN-based model to generate realistic masked face images using various GAN architectures like Inception V2, Xception and others
Each section includes **assignments** to reinforce learning, along with **solutions** for self-assessment.
