# GenAI

Welcome to the **GenAI** section! Generative AI (GenAI) refers to a category of artificial intelligence models designed to generate new content, such as text, images, or even code, based on given prompts or input data. Unlike traditional AI, which mainly focuses on classification or prediction, GenAI can create responses, stories, designs, or solutions by learning patterns from large datasets.

In this repository, the GenAI section focuses on using Generative AI to automatically search, retrieve, and summarize information from the web. This approach can be especially useful for applications requiring real-time information gathering and efficient data summarization.

**Note**: This folder is intended for beginners, introducing basic genAI concepts. It serves as an entry point and does not cover all available methods. Please refer to the resources below to deepen your understanding.
