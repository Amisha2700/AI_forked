# Spam Detection using Logistic Regression

This project uses **Logistic Regression** to classify SMS messages as **spam** or **ham** (not spam). The dataset used is the SMS Spam Collection Dataset.

## Features

- Text preprocessing using **NLTK** (stopwords removal, tokenization, etc.).
- Feature extraction using **TF-IDF Vectorization**.
- Model training using **Scikit-Learn's Logistic Regression**.
- Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
