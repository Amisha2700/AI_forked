# Early Stopping in Deep Neural Networks (DNN)

## Overview
This project demonstrates the application of **Early Stopping** to enhance training efficiency in a **Deep Neural Network (DNN)** using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**. Early Stopping mitigates overfitting by terminating training when the validation loss ceases to improve.
